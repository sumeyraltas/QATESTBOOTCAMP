to running test;

-write locust -f "file name".py (store.py & main.py)  
-open http://localhost:8089

First I tested for main.py file

Number of users (peak concurrency) and Spawn rate (users started/second) as 1

Host (e.g. http://www.example.com) as https://petstore.swagger.io 

then, I raised the numbers.

Ypu can observe the results from the pdfs above.
